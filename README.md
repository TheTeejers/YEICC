I made a basic web app that calls out to the GitHub API and allows for you to
get the open issues from the Rails repo.

I used React and JavaScript to get this challenge complete.  Interaction with
the web app is pretty straight forward.  Select the criteria you would like
to search for (issue labels and number of issues returned) and click on the
 search button.

The app returns the title of the issue (linked to the repo), the date the issue
was created, the number of comments that the issue has received (which can be
filtered in the search options), and also the submitting user name and avatar.


The App is responsive and usable on a cell phone or tablet.
